* Implement HostTest.
* Implement ConnectionTest.
* Merge tests from SpiffWorkqueue to tests/Exscript/workqueue/.
* Add tests for remaining util modules.
* Is there a sane way to test stdlib?
* Warn for untested methods.
* Check whether merging workqueue.Action and workqueue.Job makes sense.
* Add a workqueue method for putting jobs to sleep until another job is
  completed, and use that in sys.run() and Queue.wait_for() instead of
  polling. This will also let us get rid of force_run() everywhere.
* Check for places where polling is used, and get rid of it.
* Try to move the remote_os detection into a stream monitor, instead of
  hard wiring it into the authentication procedure.
