* Test the exscript executable.
* Test Queue constructor kwargs.
* Opening the connection in authenticate() has a drawback: If the host
  does not respond, the account passed to authenticate() is locked for a
  very long time. So try to make sure to open the connection before that.
* Test the Transport wait parameters in several cases:
   - Login with username only.
   - Login with password only.
   - Login with both.
   - Login with key.
* Create more stdlib tests like tests/templates/stdlib.crypt/.
