* Opening the connection in authenticate() has the drawback: If the host
  does not respond, the account passed to authenticate() is locked for a
  very long time. So try to make sure to open the connection before that.
* Add cast.to_account() and to_accounts() and use that in the account manager.
* Test the Transport wait parameters in several cases:
   - Login with username only.
   - Login with password only.
   - Login with both.
   - Login with key.
* Add a way for redirecting output channels.
* Test verbosity by monitoring the output channels for the following cases:
  (S = status bar,
   L = live conversation,
   E = errors,
   ! = errors with tracebacks,
   F = fatal errors with tracebacks)
     - verbose = -1: stdout = None, stderr = F
     - verbose =  0: stdout = None, stderr = EF
     - verbose =  1, hosts = 1: stdout = M, stderr = EF
     - verbose =  1, hosts = n: stdout = S, stderr = EF
     - verbose =  2, hosts = 1: stdout = M, stderr = !F
     - verbose =  2, hosts = n: stdout = S, stderr = !F
* Create more stdlib tests like tests/templates/stdlib.crypt/.
