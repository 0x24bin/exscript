Installing the Exscript daemon
------------------------------
The Exscript daemon is a server that takes an order and runs services
asynchronously. It may, for example, be used as a backend for running
Exscript through a web server.

Prerequisite: Exscript is already installed and working.

The following instructions should work on Debian based Linux
distributions. On other systems the procedure will probably differ.

- Define the directories for the following steps:

    export EXSCRIPT_LOG=/var/log/exscriptd
    export EXSCRIPT_SPOOL=/var/spool/exscriptd
    export EXSCRIPT_CFG=/etc/exscriptd

- Create the required directories:

    sudo mkdir -p $EXSCRIPT_LOG $EXSCRIPT_SPOOL $EXSCRIPT_CFG

- Copy the config file:

    sudo cp config.xml.tmpl $EXSCRIPT_CFG/config.xml

- Edit the config file: You need to define the user accounts
  that are used by Exscript to contact your hosts.
  In other words, edit the <account-pool> section accordingly.
  To encrypt a password, the following command may be used:

    python -c 'import base64; print base64.b64encode("thepassword")'

- Copy the init script:

    sudo cp util/exscriptd_init.sh /etc/init.d/exscriptd

- If you used a custom installation path, you'll need to edit
  the path in /etc/init.d/exscriptd accordingly.

- You may now test the daemon. This command starts the server:

    sudo /etc/init.d/exscriptd start

   !!!
   Note that by default, the Exscript daemon does not provide
   any services. In other words, all orders sent to the daemon
   are rejected.

   To define a service, you'll need to create an XML file similar
   to the one shipped in

     tests/Exscript/daemon/testservice/test.xml

   You may then tell exscriptd to load the service by
   adding it to /etc/exscript/config.xml using the <load-service>
   XML tag under the daemon. For example:

      <load-service name="myservice" load="/path/to/my/service.xml"/>
   !!!

- To automatically start the daemon at boot time, use the following
  command:

    sudo update-rc.d exscriptd defaults
