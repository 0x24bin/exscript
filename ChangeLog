	* lib/Exscript/*.py: Greatly improved the error handling of the parser.
	* lib/Exscript/Regex.py, lib/Exscript/Regex.py: Detect whether the correct
	number of match groups is used in a regular expression.
	* lib/Exscript/Execute.py, lib/Exscript/TerminalConnection/*.py: Moved the
	response error handling out of the Exscript interpreter into the connection
	code. This will let us improve error handling in the future.

2007-09-22 Samuel Abels <http://debain.org>

	* lib/Exscript/String.py: It is now possible to use \r and \n in strings.
	* lib/Exscript/ExpressionNode.py: Strings may now be concatenated using the
	"." operator.
	* lib/Exscript/Code.py, lib/Exscript/ExpressionNode.py: Added "in" and "not
	in" operators for searching through a list.

2007-09-21 Samuel Abels <http://debain.org>

	* lib/Exscript/Execute.py, lib/Exscript/Token.py, lib/Exscript/String.py:
	Fixed a bug that escaping of some characters outside of code context did not
	work.
	Fixed another bug that escaping quotes in a string would not work. Added 
	support for using $-prefixed variable names in strings.
	* lib/Exscript/Execute.py: Added the builtin variable "response", that now
	includes the response of the last command.
	* lib/Exscript/Exscript.py: #-prefixed lines are now comments.

2007-09-20 Samuel Abels <http://debain.org>

	* lib/Exscript/*.py: Added missing copyleft headers.
	* lib/Exscript/stdlib/*: Reorganized the standard library such that every
	function has it's own file. Fixed sys.wait().
	* lib/Exscript/Parser.py: Fixed the debug argument of the constructor.

2007-09-19 Samuel Abels <http://debain.org>

	* *.py: Backported such that Python 2.2 is now also supported.
	* exscript.py: Load the protocol adapters dynamically, such that 
	SSH related modules are not required when Telnet is used.
	* lib/TerminalConnection/*.py: Further improved prompt recognition.

2007-09-12 Samuel Abels <http://debain.org>

	* lib/TerminalConnection/T*.py: Reworked the telnet adapter such that it
	supports negotiation. This means that a connection should now automatically
	choose a script-friendly terminal type. (e.g. one that uses no color control
	characters).
	* lib/Exscript/Loop.py: Fixed a bug that some operations would not work when
	accessing the iterator variable in the body of a loop tag.
	* lib/Exscript/Loop.py: Added support for "while" and "until" loops.
	* lib/Exscript/Extract.py: Added support for "into" keyword.
	* lib/WorkQueue/Job.py: Use friendlier thread names.
	* lib/Exscript/*.py: Fix: In several cases accessing a variable could fail.

2007-09-10 Samuel Abels <http://debain.org>

	* lib/Exscript/Loop.py: Loops can now iterate over multiple lists at once.
	* lib/TerminalConnection/: Added the humble beginnings of an SSH adapter
	based on pexpect.
	* Relased 0.9.8.

2007-09-07 Samuel Abels <http://debain.org>

	* lib/TerminalConnection/T*.py: Further improved prompt recognition.
	Correctly filter out telnet control characters.

2007-08-01 Samuel Abels <http://debain.org>

	* lib/TerminalConnection/T*.py: Improved prompt recognition. (#4)

2007-07-17 Samuel Abels <http://debain.org>

	* lib/Exscript/*.py: Check regular expression syntax at compile time.

2007-07-13 Samuel Abels <http://debain.org>

	* exscript.py: Add support for selecting the protocol using -p or
	--protocol.
	* exscript.py: Add support for URL formatted hostnames. (#2)

2007-07-11 Samuel Abels <http://debain.org>

	* lib/WorkQueue/*.py, lib/TerminalActions/*.py: Be more strict with
	the locking. This should not make a difference with the current
	implementation of Python, but that might change in the future.

2007-07-02 Samuel Abels <http://debain.org>

	* all-over: Use new-style classes.
	* lib/Exscript/stdlib/Device.py: Moved set_timeout and set_prompt
	  into new class.
	* lib/Exscript/stdlib/Connection.py (set_timeout, set_prompt): New.
	* lib/Exscript/stdlib/Sys.py (message): New.
	* lib/Exscript/Parser.py: Improved variable initialization.
	* lib/Exscript/Program.py: Dito.
	* lib/Exscript/Scope.py: Dito.
	* lib/Exscript/Code.py: Implemented support for variable assignment.
	* lib/Exscript/Assign.py: New.
	* lib/TerminalTransport/Telnet.py: Cleanups.
	* lib/TerminalActions/Connect.py: Send a notification when connecting.
	* lib/TerminalActions/Authenticate.py: Fix a deadlock that happened when
	  an error occured during authentication.
	* lib/TerminalActions/Authorize.py: Dito.
	* lib/TerminalActions/LoggedSequence.py: Catch logfile errors so that
	  the lock is released even when logging is broken.

2007-06-30 Samuel Abels <http://debain.org>

	* Exscript/*.py: Fix: Runtime error handling was broken when
	compiling two scripts using the same compiler instance.

	* Initial release 0.9
