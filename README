= Exscript =

Exscript is a script and template language for automating network connections 
over protocols such as Telnet or SSH. Exscript is targeted at non-developers 
and developers alike.

Exscript is often used to automate sessions with routers from Cisco, Juniper, 
Huawei, or others. Are you an administrator who often configures machines 
running Linux/Unix, IOS, IOS-XR, JunOS, VRP, or any other operating system 
that can be used with a terminal? Then Exscript is for you!

Exscript is in some ways comparable to Expect, but has some unique features 
that make it a lot easier to use and understand for non-developers.
